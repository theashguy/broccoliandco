# Broccoli and Co

"The more niche your business idea, the better. Just keep niching down until you can't find anymore more niche. I'm like, 70% sure thats the way it works.'" - Steve Tzu, The Art of Tech Bro.

Broccoli and Co is a new invite-only Broccoli themed software developer coworking space and cafe as a service (or CSACaaS) launching in Melbourne in 2022 to take advantage of the inevitable post pandemic craze for broccoli based foodstuffs and associated paraphenalia.

This repo contains the holding page for the future website that (for the time being) allows the public to submit their details for a possible invite during the upcoming "Broccolottery" event.

The website can be viewed at its staging location at https://broccoliandco.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then launch the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the tests (this will auto-rerun tests that are changed):

```bash
npm run test
```

And to deploy a new version push to the master branch, or raise a PR (in which case you'll get a nice test URL generated for you by Vercel).
